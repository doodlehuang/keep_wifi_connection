# keep_wifi_connection
A daemon-like script that keeps your Wi-Fi connection up on Windows in case your PC has a buggy wireless adapter.

Consider using [this batch script alternative by Hao Tian](https://github.com/HaoTian22/UIC-Utilities/blob/main/README-AutoRestartWIFI.md) instead if you want a simpler solution using less system resource. There is also more infomation on his page about setting up startup scripts.
