# keep_wifi_connection
A daemon-like script that keeps your Wi-Fi connection up on Windows in case your PC has a buggy wireless adapter.

Consider using [this batch script alternative by Hao Tian](https://github.com/HaoTian22/UIC-Utilities/blob/main/AutoRestartWIFI.bat) instead if you want a simpler solution using less system resource.
